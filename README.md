# binforge
BinForge is a compact tool for assembling, linking, and executing x86_64 assembly programs. Ideal for hackers, reverse engineers, and developers, it streamlines converting raw assembly into executables. Whether testing exploits, debugging shellcode, or crafting binaries, BinForge makes the process quick and efficient. ðŸš€


# Usage:

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

# More functionality
You can use GEF. GEF is a free and open-source GDB plugin that is built precisely for reverse engineering and binary exploitation. 
```bash
$ wget -O ~/.gdbinit-gef.py -q https://gef.blah.cat/py
$ echo source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit
```
